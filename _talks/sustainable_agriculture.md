China’s agricultural sector holds a historically prominent position, serving as a foundation for establishing a socialist modernized powerhouse. 
Sustainable agricultural development represents a core component of high-quality agricultural advancement and is essential to the nation’s strategy for agricultural modernization.
As one of China’s primary greenhouse gas emitters and a significant carbon sink, the agricultural sector plays a pivotal role in national climate efforts. 
However, against the backdrop of rising global climate risks, China’s agricultural resilience remains limited. 
Fostering a low-carbon and climate-adaptive agricultural sector and advancing structural transformation are central to achieving sustainable agricultural development. 
Drawing on extensive case studies from both domestic and international sources, this blue paper examines how commercial banks, by leveraging a “commercial banking + investment banking” model, can finance agricultural emission reductions, carbon sequestration efforts, and climate resilience, thereby contributing to sustainable development in agriculture.
