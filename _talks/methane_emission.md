Methane ranks as the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas, notable for its high warming potential and short atmospheric lifespan. Mitigating methane emissions yields substantial climate, economic, environmental, and safety benefits. In November 2023, China integrated the control of non-CO₂ greenhouse gases into its national climate strategy, thereby catalyzing efforts by governments, firms, and financial institutions to accelerate methane reduction. As a critical element of climate finance, methane reduction finance is poised to play a central role in advancing green finance initiatives. This report recommends that commercial banks broaden financing models oriented toward ecological sustainability, actively participate in climate financing aimed at methane control, and unlock the carbon credit potential embedded in methane reduction projects. Additionally, banks should support technological innovation in emission reduction through science and technology financing, while promoting Sino-U.S. collaboration on methane through cross-border financial services.
