I am an applied microeconomist currently employed at the Agricultural Bank of China. My research utilizes both reduced-form econometric techniques and structural modeling to investigate key issues in environmental economics, climate change, and agricultural finance.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland-College Park in 2018, under the supervision of Professor [Sebastien Houde](https://sebastien-houde.com) (now at HEC Lausanne), and completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Renmin University of China.
