I am an assistant professor in [Carbon Neutrality and Climate Change Thrust](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/society-hub/carbon-neutrality-and-climate-change/) of [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research utilizes both reduced-form econometric techniques and structural modeling to investigate key issues in environmental economics, climate change, and sustainable finance.

I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Maryland-College Park in 2018, under the supervision of Professor [Sebastien Houde](https://sebastien-houde.com) (now at HEC Lausanne), and completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Renmin University of China.
