I am an applied micro-economist and currently work at the Agricultural Bank of China. I employ both reduced-form econometrics and structural modeling methods to explore critical issues in environmental economics, climate change, and agricultural finance. 

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland-College Park in 2018, supervised by Professor Sebastien Houde (now in HEC Lausanne), and received my bachelor and master degree from Renmin University of China.
