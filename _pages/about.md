I am an assistant professor in [Thrust of Carbon Neutrality and Climate Change](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/society-hub/carbon-neutrality-and-climate-change/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research utilizes both reduced-form econometric techniques and structural modeling to investigate key issues in environmental economics, climate change, and sustainable finance.

I received my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2018, where I was advised by Professor [Sébastien Houde](https://sebastien-houde.com) (now at HEC Lausanne). Prior to that, I completed both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Finance at Renmin University of China.
