This paper employs China’s regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) pilots as a
quasi-natural experiment to examine the impact of climate change regulations on
corporate short-term debt financing decisions. The empirical analysis indicates that
the introduction of the ETS results in a 27.8% reduction in short-term financial
leverage among regulated firms compared to their non-regulated counterparts, while
keeping unchanged in their long-term debt. This effect is particularly pronounced for
firms headquartered in regions with lower free quota rates, those with less
government ownership, and those facing higher product market competition. The
mechanism analysis suggests that the regional ETS has increased firms’ environmental compliance costs and financial distress risks, prompting a reduction in
short-term debt financing. These findings substantiate the argument that the ETS has
inadvertently impaired manufacturing firms’ access to short-term credit by elevating
their distress risk. This research underscores the unintended consequences of climate
policy on the maturity structure of corporate debt
