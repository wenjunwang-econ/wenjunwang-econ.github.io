This study investigates the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) adoption and carbon emissions within Chinese firms. By employing a novel text-based measure to quantify AI adoption, we identify a negative association between AI integration and carbon emission intensities. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in AI investment correlates with a 2.29 percentage point decrease in carbon emission intensities. The impact is particularly significant for state-owned enterprises, high-emission firms, and firms located in non-eastern regions. Mechanism analysis indicates that reductions in carbon emission intensities are driven by enhancements in energy management efficiency and growth in green innovation. Overall, our findings underscore AIâ€™s potential as a crucial instrument in addressing climate change.
