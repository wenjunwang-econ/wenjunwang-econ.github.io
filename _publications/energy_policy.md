This paper employs China’s regional Emissions Trading System (ETS) pilots as a quasi-natural experiment to 
examine the impact of climate change regulations on corporate short-term debt financing decisions. The 
empirical analysis indicates that the introduction of the ETS results in a 30.4% reduction in short-term financial 
leverage among regulated firms compared to their non-regulated counterparts, while keeping unchanged in their 
long-term debt. This effect is particularly pronounced for firms headquartered in regions with lower free quota 
rates and those with less government ownership. The mechanism analysis suggests that the regional ETS has 
increased firms’ environmental compliance costs and financial distress risks, prompting a reduction in short-term 
debt financing. These findings substantiate the argument that the ETS has inadvertently impaired firms’ access to 
short-term credit by elevating their distress risk. This research underscores the unintended consequences of 
climate policy on the maturity structure of corporate debt.
